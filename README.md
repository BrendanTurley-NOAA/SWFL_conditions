# West Florida Shelf Conditions

The bottom temperature, salinity, and currents were extracted from the global [HYCOM](https://www.hycom.org) 1/12 degree output. The current conditions are the mean of the past 48 hours. The past 7-day and next 7-day forecast trends are linear slopes of those respective time periods. Any slopes that have a p-values > 0.01 are white. Overlaid on the trends are the mean bottom currents during that same time period.
