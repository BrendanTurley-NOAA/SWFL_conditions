# West Florida Shelf Conditions

The bottom temperature, salinity, and currents were extracted from the global [HYCOM](https://www.hycom.org) 1/12 degree output.

The current conditions are the mean bottom temperature and salinity of the past 48 hours. Overlaid arrows are the mean bottom currents during that same time period. Stratification is defined as surface values subtracted from the bottom values then divided by the water depth. This gives some indication of the strength of the thermocline and halocline and resistance to water column mixing due to things like wind and waves.

The past 7-day and next 7-day forecast trends are linear slopes of those respective time periods. Any slopes that have a p-values > 0.05 are white. Overlaid arrows on the trends are the mean bottom currents during that same time period.
